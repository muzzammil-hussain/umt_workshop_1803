# Simple Flask, Expressjs and Reactjs Demo

This repo is created to give an overview about basics of backend frameworks Flask which is written in Python, Expressjs which is written in Nodejs and frontend library React. We created a small REST API in Flask and Expressjs which serves same json data. And frontend React uses it without any changes except API URL.

This repo is made for **UMT Lahore workshop** happening in March, 2018
